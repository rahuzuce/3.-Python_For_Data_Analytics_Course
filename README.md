# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter US Jobs

To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [2_Skill_Count](3_Project/2_Skills_Demand.ipynb). Some snippet is shown below.

### Visualize Data

```python
# Plot the horizontal bar charts
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(10, 9), sharex=True)

# Define a function to plot each bar chart
def plot_skills(ax, skills, title):
    # Convert Series to DataFrame
    df = skills.reset_index()
    df.columns = ['skill', 'percent']

    # Plot with seaborn
    palette = sns.color_palette("Blues_d", len(df))[::-1]  # Reverse the colors
    sns.barplot(data=df, y='skill', x='percent', ax=ax, palette=palette)
    # Add labels on bars
    for i, v in enumerate(df['percent']):
        ax.text(v + 0.5, i, f'{v}%', va='center', fontsize=10)

    # Titles and labels
    ax.set_title(title, fontsize=13)
    ax.set_xlabel('Percentage of Jobs Requiring Skill')
    ax.set_ylabel('Skill')
    ax.set_xlim(0, df['percent'].max() + 10)  # Extra space for label text

# Plot for each job title
plot_skills(axes[0], data_analyst_skills, 'Top 5 Skills for Data Analyst')
plot_skills(axes[1], data_engineer_skills, 'Top 5 Skills for Data Engineer')
plot_skills(axes[2], data_scientist_skills, 'Top 5 Skills for Data Scientist')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [3_Skills_Trend](3_Project/3_Skills_Trend.ipynb). Some snippet is shown below.

### Visualize Data

```python

sns.lineplot(data=df_pivot, dashes=False, hue_order=list_top_5_skills)
sns.set_theme(style="ticks")

for i in range(len(list_top_5_skills)):
    plt.text(x=9, y=df_pivot.iloc[8, i] + 0.5, s=df_pivot.columns[i], fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(range(1, 13), ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'])

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.show()

```

### Results

- Sas, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](3_Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb). Some snippet is shown below.

#### Visualize Data 

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(
    x='salary_year_avg',
    y='job_title_short',
    data=df_top_6,
    order=sorted_job_titles,  # Sort y-axis by median salary
)
import matplotlib.ticker as mtick
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x / 1000)}K'))

plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US](3_Project/images/Salary_Distribution.png)  
*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles.*

#### Insights

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior/ Junior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers on the higher end.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 12))

# Plot 1: Top 10 Highest Paying Skills
sns.barplot(
    data=top_10_paying_skills_df.reset_index(),
    x='salary_year_avg',
    y='job_skills',
    hue='salary_year_avg',
    ax=ax1,
    palette='light:b',
)

# Plot 2: Top 10 In-Demand Skills
sns.barplot(
    data=top_10_demand_skills_df.reset_index(),
    x='salary_year_avg',
    y='job_skills',
    hue='salary_year_avg',
    ax=ax2,
    palette='light:b',
)
plt.show()

```

#### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US](3_Project/images/Salary_Across_Roles_And_Skills_for_DA.png)
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US.*

#### Insights:

- The top graph shows specialized technical skills like `dplyr`, `Bitbucket`, and `Gitlab` are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.

- The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like `Excel`, `PowerPoint`, and `SQL` are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.

- There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills.

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_Optimal_Skills](3_Project/5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data

```python
sns.scatterplot(
    data=skill_stats,
    x='percentage_of_jobs',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology'
)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
plt.show()
```

#### Results
